        Visually, we feel that Amour PWA is more polished and vastly different compared to its desktop app counterpart.
        It is also more reactive, adaptive and more responsive; the in-app animations are improved;
        together these changes make for an effortless and tailored experience. Your background colors are now adapable to your
        album genres and change colors accordingly,
        making your experience more personalized and unique—as a music player should be. We felt as
        though Amour PWA went through a revamp when it comes to its functionality!
        Menus such as Playlists, Made for you, Albums … are now relocated to the above of the main section, making the left panel
        less clustered and enabling more room for users. This is especially useful for music enthusiasts who have lots of
        playlists and in need of more space or users who are more on the orderly side and can’t stand a crowded UI.
