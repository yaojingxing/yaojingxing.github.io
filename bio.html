            Hi,my name is Jingxing Yao, a big fun of science and history. Everything like miracle takes my fancy a lot.
            I think that's the reason why I am so fonded with front-end development, since it is a mixture of aesthetics
            and technology. A decently designed app or web page is truly an artifect.<br>
            I am a big fun of javascript and typescript.My goal is to design some elegant-styled web framework like Vue.js or Koa.js
            webframe work should follow reactive and MVVC software design phyolosophy.
            I am really interested in sports,like swimming and basketball,also I like singing in my spare time
