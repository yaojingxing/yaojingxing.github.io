            Hi,my name is Jingxing Yao, a big fun of science and history. Everything like miracle takes my fancy a lot. I think that's the reason why I am so fonded with front-end development, since it is a mixture of aesthetics and technology. A decently designed app or web page
            is truly an artifect.
            I am a big fun of javascript and typescript.
